				quantifiedOutcome="Saved a $900k ARR account from churning"
				situation="Our largest account was about to churn. A clinical AI was generating false patient data, and our broken release process had destroyed all trust."
				intervention={[
					'Triage: I took immediate ownership on customer calls. I used radical candor to absorb the chaos and turn a hostile situation productive.',
					'The Mirror: I built a V1 Health Dashboard that became the single source of truth. It forced data-driven conversations about the platform\'s real-time failures.',
					'The New Treaty: Armed with data, I led the negotiation to redesign our release process. We co-created a new protocol with a mandatory customer "Go/No-Go" before every production release. This gave them the control they needed to trust us again.'
				]}
				keyResults={[
					'Saved a $900k ARR account from churning.',
					'Created a new Enterprise Release Protocol now used to de-risk all high-stakes accounts.',

				situation="A YC-backed, Series A client was in crisis. A 'move fast and break things' culture created a breaking product, a burned-out team, and a P0 churn risk with their largest account."
				intervention={[
					'Diagnosis: The root cause was a leadership failure. The company had a "hype-driven" strategy with no rational system for prioritizing work.',
					'System Architecture: I built a new GTM operating system from the bottom up. It included a data-driven "Account Health" framework, a "GTM Blocker Triage" ritual to align Sales and Engineering, and a "P0 Incident Response" playbook.'
