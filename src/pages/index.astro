			<CaseStudy
				title="The Crisis Manager"
				oneLiner="Retaining a $900k enterprise account by transforming a P0 crisis into a new company protocol."
				keyResults={[
					'Retained a $900k ARR strategic account that was on the brink of churning.',
					'Created the V1 of a new Enterprise Release Protocol, a playbook now used to de-risk other high-stakes accounts.',
					'Transformed the account from a churn risk into our most important design partner for stability.'
				]}
				situation="Our largest account was about to churn. A clinical integrity crisis, where the AI generated false patient data, combined with a broken internal release process had completely destroyed their trust."
				intervention={[
					'Phase 1: Triage & Containment. My first step was to absorb the chaos. I took immediate ownership on customer calls, using radical candor to validate their frustration and de-escalate the situation from hostile to productive.',
					"Phase 2: The 'Mirror of Reality'. I built the V1 MIDI Health Dashboard. This 'mirror' became the single source of truth, replacing emotional debates with data-driven conversations about the real-time impact of our platform's failures.",
					"Phase 3: The 'New Treaty'. Armed with data, I led the negotiation to redesign our release process. We co-created a new protocol: a weekly release to a staging URL with a mandatory customer 'Go/No-Go' before production, giving them the control needed to regain trust."
				]}
				playbook={[
					'Absorb Chaos with Candor: Own the failure to de-escalate.',
					'Build a Data-Driven Mirror: Replace opinions with objective reality.',
					'Co-design the System: Partner with the customer to create a durable fix.'

			<div id="cs-turnaround" class="scroll-mt-24">
			<CaseStudy
				title="The Turnaround Operator"
				oneLiner="Unlocking a $2.2M enterprise pipeline by sunsetting a high-drain SMB segment."
				keyResults={[
					"Unlocked 20%+ of GTM & Success team capacity to focus on a $2.2M enterprise pipeline.",
					"Cut reactive 'squeaky wheel' fire drills by over 50% in two weeks.",
					"Shipped the V1 of a new company operating system for making data-driven strategic trade-offs."
				]}
				situation="The company was stuck. A 'say yes to everything' culture created two businesses at war: a high-touch Enterprise motion and a high-drain SMB segment. The result was a burned-out team, a breaking product, and over $350k in unprofitable, high-risk ARR."
				intervention={[
					"Force Clarity with Data (The Mirror): I built the V1 Account Health report that proved the SMB segment was a massive drain and quantified the $2.2M+ enterprise pipeline we were ignoring. This data forced a clear 'Go/No-Go' decision.",
					"Architect the 'Graceful Off-Ramp' (The Playbook): I created the V1 playbook to execute the pivot cleanly, with a framework to protect high-potential 'Acorn' accounts and a new self-service model for the rest.",
					"Build a Coalition to Execute (The Culture): I ran sessions with Sales, Success, and Support to get their buy-in and turn the strategy into a real-world plan, personally handling the first few difficult customer calls to de-risk the process."
				]}
				playbook={[
					'Use data to make the invisible costs visible.',
					'Architect a playbook to de-risk the execution.',
					'Build a coalition to turn the strategy into culture.'

			<div id="cs-venture" class="scroll-mt-24">
			<CaseStudy
				title="The Venture Builder"
				oneLiner="From zero to a signed enterprise pilot in 11 weeks."
				keyResults={[
					"Diagnosed the true 'hair-on-fire' problem for daycare directors in 25+ interviews.",
					"Architected a fully compliant 'On-Demand Floater' operational model in a complex regulatory maze.",
					"Secured a formal pilot agreement with a major multi-site operator (Little Scholars)."
				]}
				situation="The prompt was simple: build a new labor marketplace from scratch. I targeted the ECE sector, diagnosed a crippling 'staffing crisis,' and designed a compliant solution to address it."
				intervention={[
					"Diagnosing the Real Problem: My first idea was wrong. 25+ interviews confirmed the true 'hair-on-fire' problem wasn't just hiring, but the daily chaos of last-minute staff absences, a problem complicated by strict regulations.",
					"Architecting a Compliant Operation: The biggest risk was the regulatory maze. I uncovered a critical, non-obvious insight. Assistant Teachers can be cleared for multiple sites concurrently, while Lead Teachers cannot. This became the foundation of the business model.",
					"Driving to a Signed Pilot: With a validated model, I shifted to go to market. I built the V1 assets: a simple pricing model, a clear pitch deck, and a functional mockup. I secured a pilot agreement with a leading NYC operator."
				]}
				playbook={[
					"Find the 'hair-on-fire' problem, not the stated one.",
					"Find the non-obvious regulatory 'cheat code'.",
					"Build the minimum viable assets to get to a pilot."
